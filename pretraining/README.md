# Pretraining Scripts

These are the pre-training scripts for SSL models: [`MoCov2`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpretrain/tree/main/configs/mocov2), [`BYOL`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpretrain/tree/main/configs/byol), and [`DINO`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino); as well as supervised models. This is done for both conventional (standard) ResNet50s as well as the inherently interpretable [`B-cos`](https://github.com/B-cos/B-cos-v2/tree/main) ResNet50s.
